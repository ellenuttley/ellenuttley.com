{/* personal statement */}
  <div class="mybox col-span-8">I am an enthusiastic junior software engineer, excited to get started in the real world.
My logical and original way of thinking means that I often come at problems in ways that no one else has considered, and my drive for perfection means that I will put in the hours needed to make those solutions a reality. 
This year I completed the CFGDegree Software Engineering bootcamp, elevating my skills in Python and SQL and honing those skills through projects. As one of the top performers, I was offered a place on the +Masters bootcamp for App Development, where I learnt how to make React Native mobile apps, and achieved the highest grade in my cohort of 97%. 
While my passion and talent lies primarily in backend development, I have an eye for UX and design, and an excellent ability to match front ends to those designs. I enjoy utilising my writing background to make my code dry and readable.</div>
